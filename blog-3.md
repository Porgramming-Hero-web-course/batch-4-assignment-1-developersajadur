Topic: Why are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.

The Relevance of Type Guards in Typescript. Types and their purposes this topic focuses on a key TypeScript feature useful for mid-level developers who wish to do more to ensure that their code is robust. In TypeScript, the concept of narrowing down the types at runtime is an advanced feature that can help reduce the complexity of the code and, to some extent, make the code easy to handle and read. 

Reasons in Support of Such Decision: 

Benefits: Type guards are valuable for writing TypeScript safely and in a maintainable manner. This is especially useful for a programming team, which may easily be able to complete a project, but behind is the code writing on the application. 

Anticipated Audience: The majority of TypeScript programmers have problems with type control in complicated architecture, hence this subject will probably inspire readers’ wishes to learn this high-grade skill.

Scope of Educational Activities: This enables you to introduce different types of type guards (such as using typeof, instanceof, custom type guards, and in) and give examples for each before explaining the importance of type guards in a system. 

Proposed Plan to Organization Your Blogging Activity: 

(1) Introduction: 
Introduce the concept of TypeScript and its use concerning type safety. 
State the risk posed by using the incorrect type at run time and the respect to which, type guards intend to address that risk. 

The Importance of Utilizing Type Guards :

Discuss their relevance in providing assurance when manipulating different types, especially when working with large codes. 
Explain how incorporating type guards helps improve code structure and makes code safer and easier to understand. 

Types of Type Guards:

Explore the types of guard methods and use cases in detail: 
- basic types
- instances of classes 
- let’s build some custom-type guards 
- include the property ‘in’. 

Real World usage: 

Explore the type safety provided by type guards in real-life code, such as interacting with varying types of data in a secure manner.
